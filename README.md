+# Profession Identifier
+
+A machine learning application that analyzes resumes and classifies them into professional categories.
+
+## Overview
+
+This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze resume text and predict the most suitable job category for the candidate. The application is built with a Streamlit frontend for easy interaction.
+
+## Features
+
+- Upload resume files in TXT or PDF format
+- Text preprocessing to clean and standardize resume content
+- Classification into 39 different professional categories
+- Simple and intuitive web interface
+
+## Technologies Used
+
+- Python
+- Streamlit (for web interface)
+- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
+- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
+- Joblib (for model serialization)
+
+## Installation
+
+1. Clone this repository:
+   ```
+   git clone <repository-url>
+   cd Profession_Identifier
+   ```
+
+2. Install the required dependencies:
+   ```
+   pip install streamlit nltk joblib scikit-learn
+   ```
+
+3. Download the required NLTK resources:
+   ```python
+   import nltk
+   nltk.download('punkt')
+   nltk.download('stopwords')
+   ```
+
+## Usage
+
+1. Make sure you have the trained model files (`best_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`) in the project directory.
+
+2. Run the Streamlit application:
+   ```
+   streamlit run front.py
+   ```
+
+3. Upload a resume in TXT or PDF format through the web interface.
+
+4. The application will process the resume and display the predicted job category.
+
+## Job Categories
+
+The application can classify resumes into 39 different professional categories, including:
+- Data Science
+- HR
+- Advocate
+- Web Designing
+- Mechanical Engineer
+- Python Developer
+- Business Analyst
+- And many more...
+
+## Project Structure
+
+- `front.py`: The main Streamlit application file
+- `best_model.pkl`: Trained machine learning model (needs to be created)
+- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer for text processing (needs to be created)
+- `resume.txt`: Sample resume for testing
+
+## Future Improvements
+
+- Add support for more file formats (DOCX, HTML, etc.)
+- Improve model accuracy with more training data
+- Add confidence scores for predictions
+- Implement more detailed analysis of resume content
